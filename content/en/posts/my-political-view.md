In China, the people and even the grassroots party members have little opportunitycan participate in politics, however, such rights are provided in the law but in fact this right is artificially ignored.

Perhaps most Chinese people are more concerned about their living life, and not seemingly political life, but in fact the influence of politics is very huge, step by step the loss of rights may be the beginning of errors, I do hope that we can pay attention to political participation, after all
this is closely related to everyone's life.

As a former social activist in college, outstanding student cadres, outstanding graduates, class president, I was still full of optimism about the whole politics at that time. But with years of graduation, after struggling in sociaty, especially the two years of joining China Mobile
I deeply feel the personnel corruption of state-owned enterprises, with no relationship background of ordinary people in such an environment there is no room for survival (here survival means up to seek greater positions, of course, without ambitions no one could kick you off). It is not an exaggeration to say that behind every leader must have a more senior relationship in the government, this is not just gossip. 

Recently a very hot news of Zhou Gongzi just exposed the problem, Zhou Gongzi himself does not have any special education and ability, but still can won position over many highly educated children of the poor. If he has a better qualification, such people seeking a higher position is simply easy. Or the recruitment process itself is full of problems, why such one can be selected among the many students with excellent backgrounds? A secret that cannot be told.

At that time, I was very unhappy working in the system, was assigned to the township branch in the name of exercise, but the leaders of the township branch did not appreciate me, many things at the grassroots level do not need a graduate degree. More bullshit is that I was originally a technical position, was transferred to do the market. Fortunately, I was a social activist before, and dealing with people is the norm, at that time I did not say anything, simply treat it as a workout. However, everything is not as simple as imagined, this is just the beginning of the sinking.

When I found the problem, I decided it was better to return to work in the enterprise, the system is not suitable for me even if it is only state-owned enterprises(not government), because state-owned enterprises are not about efficiency. Now look back, in fact, is a phrase "no one in the court do not do officials" Many people will feel how the state enterprises are officials, in fact, is considered, state enterprises are also have administrative title, and can be transferred to the government, government officials can sometimes be transferred to state enterprises as leaders.

I'm still in the south of China, if the north of this feeling can only be deeper. We should turn a blind eye to this? The power of the individual is always small.

Back to the topic, what is my political view?

1. power means responsibility, there should be no absolute power, let alone the path of the cult of the individual again
2. the level of democracy should be constantly upgraded, political reform is not taboo, it should match the economic development, especially the upgrading of information technology, making it easier to participate in politics is very urgent
3. the error correction mechanism is very important, whether in terms of people or things, people can go up and down, things found wrong immediately adjusted

Serving the people is a good slogan, but the word people seem too big. It is recommended that public officials at different levels adjust the slogan to clarify their position in the end is to serve whom, think and act as one.
