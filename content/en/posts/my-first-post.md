## Reason

Busy work always let me find my own excuses to be lazy, so many years in the notebook pile of things gradually become junk documents, and occasionally turn to only find that I have done these things.
Still not why, I just hope I can develop to organize the work content, will have done something as automated and reproducible. Otherwise, every time you encounter similar work again to ctrl-c, ctrl-v.

## Preview

All are some historical notes, but will force myself to post a bilingual version(Chinese and English), also as a workout for the English language. Of course, it is not realistic for me to rewrite it, and since I know DeepL+grammarly.
