## 重新发文章的缘由

忙碌的工作总是让人找各自借口偷懒，这么多年笔记本里堆了一堆东西渐渐也成为垃圾文档了，偶尔翻到才发现原来自己做过这些东西。
依然不为什么，只希望自己能养成整理工作内容，将做过的东西尽可能自动化和可复制。不然每次遇到相似的工作又要 ctrl-c、ctrl-v。

## 内容预告

都是一些历史笔记，但是会强迫自己发一下双语版的，也作为对英文的锻炼。当然让我重头写肯定不现实，再说自从知道了DeepL+grammarly 神器以后

## Reason

Busy work always let me find my own excuses to be lazy, so many years in the notebook pile of things gradually become junk documents, and occasionally turn to only find that I have done these things.
Still not why, I just hope I can develop to organize the work content, will have done something as automated and reproducible. Otherwise, every time you encounter similar work again to ctrl-c, ctrl-v.

## Preview

All are some historical notes, but will force myself to post a bilingual version(Chinese and English), also as a workout for the English language. Of course, it is not realistic for me to rewrite it, and since I know DeepL+grammarly.
